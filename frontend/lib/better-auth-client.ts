// This file was created for Better-Auth integration but the current system uses a custom auth approach
// The working system uses the API endpoints defined in lib/api.ts and auth context in contexts/auth-context.tsx
// If you want to use Better-Auth, please install a stable version and update imports accordingly
console.warn('Better-Auth client not configured - using custom auth system');
